FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions

My Name is Sermed. There are three types of people in this world. People who make it happen, those who watch it happen, and some who dont know what the heck is going on. I make it happen. its that simple.

## Understanding the Path

many people find thier passions and launch through it. Its never been that easy for me. I have several talents however finding the passion to drive those talents to new hieghts were always the part where iv been held. When most ideas are covered in todays world its not easy to be unique and diffrent. I dont want to be like everyone else, i want my own different goal and path. However, I know through time this path is bound to be found.

My Favorite hobbies:
* Skating
* Video Editing
* Martial arts
* Meditation
